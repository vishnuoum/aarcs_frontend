While this disease affects several plant genera, including Sorbus, Cotoneaster, and Pyrus, it is most commonly associated with the infection of Malus trees, including species of flowering crabapple, as well as cultivated apple. The first symptoms of this disease are found in the foliage, blossoms, and developing fruits of affected trees, which develop dark, irregularly-shaped lesions upon infection. Although apple scab rarely kills its host, infection typically leads to fruit deformation and premature leaf and fruit drop, which enhance the susceptibility of the host plant to abiotic stress and secondary infection. The reduction of fruit quality and yield may result in crop losses of up to 70%, posing a significant threat to the profitability of apple producers. To reduce scab-related yield losses, growers often combine preventive practices, including sanitation and resistance breeding, with reactive measures, such as targeted fungicide or biocontrol treatments, to prevent the incidence and spread of apple scab in their crops\n\nHow to solve\n\n1. Grow scab-resistant cultivars of apples. Apples with good resistance include Akane, Chehalis, Liberty, Prima and Tydeman Red.\n 2. Apply nitrogen to leaves that have fallen to the ground in the fall to enhance decomposition of fallen leaves and make them more palatable to earthworms. Hand apply a liquid fish solution or 16-16-16 fertilizer to help with the decomposition.\n3. Shred fallen leaves in the fall with a mower to help speed up decomposition.\n4. Prune your apple trees to open up branching and allow more air circulation.\n5. When watering your apple trees, avoid getting foliage wet.\n6. Apply dolomitic lime in the fall, after leaf drop, to increase pH and to help reduce fungal spores in the spring.\n7. Spray fungicide – Bonide Captan, wettable sulfur, summer lime sulfur or Spectracide Immunox – when temperatures are above 60 degrees and the leaves or blooms are wet.","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_scab")');

In early spring, during wet weather, these galls swell and bright orange masses of spores are blown by the wind where they infect susceptible apple and crab-apple trees. The spores that develop on these trees will only infect junipers the following year. From year to year, the disease must pass from junipers to apples to junipers again; it cannot spread between apple trees.\n\nHow to solve\n\n1. Choose resistant cultivars when available.\n2. Rake up and dispose of fallen leaves and other debris from under trees.\n3. Remove galls from infected junipers. In some cases, juniper plants should be removed entirely.\n4. Apply preventative, disease-fighting fungicides labeled for use on apples weekly, starting with bud break, to protect trees from spores being released by the juniper host. This occurs only once per year, so additional applications after this springtime spread are not necessary.\n5. On juniper, rust can be controlled by spraying plants with a copper solution (0.5 to 2.0 oz/ gallon of water) at least four times between late August and late October.\n6.

Hundreds of species of trees, shrubs, vines, flowers, vegetables, fruits, grasses, field crops, and weeds can be affected by powdery mildew.\n\tThe white powdery appearance is due to large numbers of microscopic spores (conidia) borne in chains. These wind-borne spores uniquely do not require free water for germination and infection. New conidia can be produced every 3 to 14 days. If the disease is severe, the mildewed plant parts may be stunted and distorted. Leaves commonly turn yellow and wither, flowers are distorted or fewer in number, and fruit yield and quality are reduced. Mildew is most severe in crowded, shady, poorly aerated locations when nights are cool and days are warm. At maturity or in the fall, round black specks, which are sexual fruiting bodies known as cleistothecia, may form in the mildew. In the spring the cleistothecia crack open to release one or more spore sacs (asei) containing ascospores that blow to nearby plant parts and initiate infection. Overwintering also occurs as mycelial mats on crops or weeds.\n\nHow to solve\n\n1.

It can cause complete crop loss in warm, humid climates, but is virtually unknown in regions with arid summers. The name comes from the black fringe that borders growing brown patches on the leaves. The disease also attacks other parts of the plant, all green parts of the vine: the shoots, leaf and fruit stems, tendrils, and fruit. The most damaging effect is to the fruit.\n\nHow to solve\n\n1. Sanitation is extremely important. Destroy mummies, remove diseased tendrils from the wires, and select fruiting canes without lesions. It is very important not to leave mummies attached to the vine. Research has shown that mummies on the ground release most or all of their ascospores before the end of bloom. Mummies left up in the trellis can produce ascospores and conidia throughout the growing season, thus making control of this disease much more difficult. If only a few leaf lesions appear in the spring, remove these infected leaves. \n2. Plant grapes in sunny open areas that allow good air movement. If your vines are planted under trees in the shade where they do not get all day sunlight, black rot will be much more difficult to control.

Bacterial spot symptoms can be easily confused with symptoms of another tomato disease called bacterial speck.\n\nHow to solve\n\n1. A plant with bacterial spot cannot be cured.  Remove symptomatic plants from the field or greenhouse to prevent the spread of bacteria to healthy plants.  Burn, bury or hot compost the affected plants and DO NOT eat symptomatic fruit.  Although bacterial spot pathogens are not human pathogens, the fruit blemishes that they cause can provide entry points for human pathogens that could cause illness.","https://hort.extension.wisc.edu/articles/bacterial-spot-of-tomato/")');

Alternaria tomatophila is more virulent on tomato than A. solani, so in regions where A. tomatophila is found, it is the primary cause of early blight on tomato. However, if A. tomatophila is absent, A. solani will cause early blight on tomato.\nBoth pathogens can also infect potato, although A. solani is more likely to cause potato early blight than A. tomatophila. Both pathogens can also infect eggplant and several Solanaceous weeds including black nightshade (Solanum ptycanthum), and hairy nightshade (Solanum physalifolium).\n\nHow to solve\n\n1. Use pathogen-free seed, or collect seed only from disease-free plants.\n2. Rotate out of tomatoes and related crops for at least two years.\n3. Control susceptible weeds such as black nightshade and hairy nightshade, and volunteer tomato plants throughout the rotation.\n4. Fertilize properly to maintain vigorous plant growth. Particularly, do not over-fertilize with potassium and maintain adequate levels of both nitrogen and phosphorus.\n5. Avoid working in plants when they are wet from rain, irrigation, or dew.\n6. Use drip irrigation instead of overhead irrigation to keep foliage dry.\n7. Stake the plants to increase airflow around the plant and facilitate drying.

Destroy potato cull piles before the growing season begins by burying them, spreading and incorporating them into fields, or feeding them to animals.\n2. Control volunteer potato plants, as infected plants can grow from infected tubers.\n3. Seed infection is unlikely on commercially prepared tomato seed or on saved seed that has been thoroughly dried.\n4. Inspect tomato transplants for late blight symptoms prior to purchase and/or planting, as tomato transplants shipped from southern regions may be infected.\n5.

Tomato leaf mold can develop during early spring temperatures (50.9 degrees Fahrenheit) or those characteristic of summer (90 F). The optimal temperature tomato leaf mold is in the low 70s.\nSymptoms of disease include yellow spots on the upper leaf surface. Discrete masses of olive-green spores can be seen on the underside of the affected leaves. The older leaves become infected first and die prematurely. The pathogen may spread rapidly during periods of prolonged relative humidity. The disease can cause flowers to drop but usually does not affect developing fruit. If infection occurs late in the season, yield losses will be minimal, but if the disease takes hold earlier, the premature defoliation will impact yield.\n\nHow to solve\n\n1. Use drip irrigation and avoid watering foliage.\n2. Space plants to provide good air movement between rows and individual plants.\n3. Stake, string or prune to increase airflow in and around the plant.\n4. Sterilize stakes, ties, trellises etc. with 10% household bleach or commercial sanitizer.\n5.

It is one of the most destructive diseases of tomato foliage and is particularly severe in areas where wet, humid weather persists for extended periods.\n\nHow to solve\n\n1. Remove diseased leaves. If caught early, the lower infected leaves can be removed and burned or destroyed. However, removing leaves above where fruit has formed will weaken the plant and expose fruit to sunscald. At the end of the season, collect all foliage from infected plants and dispose of or bury. Do not compost diseased plants.\n2. Improve air circulation around the plants. If the plants can still be handled without breaking them, stake or cage the plants to raise them off the ground and promote faster drying of the foliage.\n3. Mulch around the base of the plants. Mulching will reduce splashing soil, which may contain fungal spores associated with debris. Apply mulch after the soil has warmed.\n4. Do not use overhead watering. Overhead watering facilitates infection and spreads the disease. Use a soaker hose at the base of the plant to keep the foliage dry. Water early in the day.\n5. Control weeds. Nightshade and horsenettle are frequently hosts of Septoria leaf spot and should be eradicated around the garden site.\n6. Use crop rotation.

Read on to learn how to treat target spot on tomatoes.\n\nHow to solve\n\n1. Remove old plant debris at the end of the growing season; otherwise, the spores will travel from debris to newly planted tomatoes in the following growing season, thus beginning the disease anew. Dispose of the debris properly and don’t place it on your compost pile unless you’re sure your compost gets hot enough to kill the spores.\n2. Rotate crops and don’t plant tomatoes in areas where other disease-prone plants have been located in the past year– primarily eggplant, peppers, potatoes or, of course– tomatoes. Rutgers University Extension recommends a three year rotation cycle to reduce soil-borne fungi.\n3. Pay careful attention to air circulation, as target spot of tomato thrives in humid conditions. Grow the plants in full sunlight. Be sure the plants aren’t crowded and that each tomato has plenty of air circulation. Cage or stake tomato plants to keep the plants above the soil.\4.

However, the most diagnostic symptoms are those in leaves.\nLeaves of infected plants are small and curl upward; and show strong crumpling and interveinal and marginal yellowing. The internodes of infected plants become shortened and, together with the stunted growth, plants often take on a bushy appearance, which is sometimes referred to as bonsai or broccoli-like growth. Flowers formed on infected plants commonly do not develop and fall off (abscise). Fruit production is dramatically reduced, particularly when plants are infected at an early age, and it is not uncommon for losses of 100% to be experienced in fields with heavily infected plants.\n\nHow to solve\n\n1. Symptomatic plants should be carefully covered by a clear or black plastic bag and tied at the stem at soil line. Cut off the plant below the bag and allow bag with plant and whiteflies to desiccate to death on the soil surface for 1-2 days prior to placing the plant in the trash. Do not cut the plant off or pull it out of the garden and toss it on the compost! The goal is to remove the plant reservoir of virus from the garden and to trap the existing virus-bearing whiteflies so they do not disperse onto other tomatoes.\n2. If symptomatic plants have no obvious whiteflies on the lower leaf surface, these plants can be cut from the garden and BURIED in the compost.\n3. Although the silverlef whitefly feeds on more than 500 plants, some of its more favorite vegetable hosts other than tomatoes include the squash and cucumber family of plants, okra, beans, peanuts & eggplant.
